## Method 2: Scroll Through Settings Categories

1. **In the Settings app**, look at the **left side** (the list of categories)
2. **Scroll down** through the list
3. Look for one of these:
   - **"Accessibility"** (with an icon that looks like a person or accessibility symbol)
   - **"System"** → then tap it → then look for "Accessibility" inside
   - **"Device"** → then tap it → then look for "Accessibility" inside

## Method 3: Different Android Versions

Depending on your Android version, Accessibility might be in different places:

### Android 12+ (newer):
- Settings → **Accessibility** (directly in main list)

### Android 11 and older:
- Settings → **System** → **Accessibility**
- OR Settings → **Device** → **Accessibility**

## Method 4: Use the App to Open Settings Directly

Let me create a button in your app that opens Accessibility Settings directly!

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The Service Must Be Installed First!

**Before you can see "Vibe" in Accessibility settings:**

1. **Make sure the app is installed** on the emulator
2. **Run the app at least once** (you already did this - you saw "Hello Android!")
3. **Then** go to Settings → Accessibility

If you don't see "Vibe" in Accessibility settings:
- The app might not be installed
- Or you need to restart the emulator
- Or the service wasn't registered properly

## What You Should See in Accessibility Settings

Once you find Accessibility settings, you should see:

1. A list of **"Downloaded apps"** or **"Installed services"**
2. In that list, you should see **"Vibe"** (or "vibe")
3. **Tap on "Vibe"**
4. **Toggle the switch to ON**
5. You might see a warning - **tap "Allow"** or **"OK"**

## Still Can't Find It?

Try this:

1. **Close Settings** completely
2. **Open Settings again**
3. **Use the search function** (Method 1 above)
4. If search doesn't work, try scrolling through **all** categories in the left menu

---

## Alternative: Check if App is Installed

1. In Settings, look for **"Apps"** or **"Applications"**
2. Tap on it
3. Look for **"Vibe"** in the list
4. If you see it, the app is installed ✅
5. If you don't see it, you need to **run the app from Android Studio again**

## Quick Test

**Right now, try this:**
1. In Settings, **tap the search icon** 🔍 at the top
2. Type: `vibe`
3. Do you see "Vibe" in the results?

If yes → Tap it → You should see the accessibility service toggle!
